## -IPL-Season-Analysis-Dashboard-2008-2025-Built-with-Power-BI📊🏏


Dive into 18 years of IPL cricket data — track season winners, runner-ups, top performers, match stats, batting and bowling trends, and dynamic team standings across all seasons. Powered by DAX and ChatGPT 🤖, this dashboard delivers rich interactivity and insights from one of the world’s biggest cricket leagues.

📌 Short Description / Purpose

The IPL Season Analysis Dashboard is a fully interactive Power BI report designed to visualize key insights from the Indian Premier League between 2008 and 2025. With AI-assisted DAX logic, it captures everything from team performance and individual player stats to season-level metrics like sixes, fours, centuries, and more — turning raw sports data into a compelling analytical story.

🛠️ Tech Stack

The dashboard is built using structured IPL datasets spanning 18 seasons. Power BI serves as the core visualization tool, enhanced by advanced DAX expressions for interactivity and calculation logic. ChatGPT was used to assist in writing optimized DAX measures and shaping the analytical narrative. The user interface features custom visuals and cricket-themed design elements for a polished experience.
